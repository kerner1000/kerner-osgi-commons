it is still not consistent!

####	Exceptions and Threadding	####
dont use "Runnable"
change every Runnable to Callable<Void>
That is because Callable throws Exception, Runnable doesnt.
Exceptions in method cannot get "outside" the Thread when using Runnable

####	synchronization				####
that really kills me...
removed all synchronization from controller.
otherwise app would always run into any deadlock.
SHOULD be save though, because model and view are threadsave.
but this is anyhow not the feine englische art...

Maybe it is doch die feine engliche art:
controller has no need to synchronize anything,
because on model and view there are no mutable oparations, that must be synchronized.
the private controller members view and model are volatile.
Therefore it should be all right.

####	cancel						####
cancellationeception is not handled right.
it behaves just like exception.
